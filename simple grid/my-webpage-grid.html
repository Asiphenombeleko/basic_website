                I would like to visit Paris some day because of the romantic atmosphere it exudes.
                I would like to customise a padlock with my initials and lock it on the Eiffel Tower
                .It is known worldwide for the Louvre Museum, Notre-Dame cathedral, and the Eiffel tower.
                It has a reputation of being a romantic and cultural city.
                The city is also known for its high-quality gastronomy and the terraces of its cafés.
                it's a mix of the city's aesthetic beauty, the abundance of romantic restaurants,
                and the magical settings we've seen so many times in movies.

        <h2>Foreign Language</h2>

        <p>
            I would like to learn French because about 45% of modern English words are of French origin and along with
            english French remains an influential language in the diplomatic world.

            <img src="../images/image1.png" width="200px" height="200px" style="float: left; padding-right: 1em">
            <p>The Iziko Slave Lodge is one of Cape Town's oldest buildings.The Slave Lodge housed the slaves who
                belonged
                to the Dutch East India Company (VOC).
                These slaves worked for the VOC and were never sold.
                The Slave Lodge was built in 1679, making it the second oldest existing colonial structure of the Cape
                Colony, today known as Cape Town.
                This building was changed many times and it is unclear how much of the existing building dates from the
                slave period.

            <p>
                Built between 1666 and 1679 by the Dutch East India Company, it's the oldest existing colonial building
                in South
                Africa
                The Castle acted as local headquarters for the South African Army in the Western Cape, and today houses
                the
                Castle Military Museum
                and ceremonial facilities for the traditional Cape Regiments.

            <img src="../images/image5.png" width="200px" height="200px" style="float: left; padding-right: 1em;">
            <p>
                The City Hall has become a central venue for creative and cultural events such as art exhibitions and
                concerts.
                One of these events includes the City Hall Sessions.City Hall is a busy place — it's where citizens come
                to interact
                with government to apply for licenses, pay fines, and attend town hall meetings.

                The mayor of Cape Town, Thomas Ball, laid the corner stone of the City Hall on 29 August 1900, but the
                hall was only opened in 1905.
